	<li>Please note that this is a large outdoor concert and may be not be a suitable environment for children under the age of 5.

		<p>lost Children</p>
			<br>
<p>If a child is found, please notify the nearest steward immediately who will radio the Electric Picnic Control Centre. A member of the Gardai will then go to the location of the lost child. A parent who has lost a child should follow the same procedure, making contact with nearest steward who will contact the Electric Picnic Control Centre.</p>
		<ul>
<li>We advise that all parents write their mobile numbers on their childâ€™s wristband, which are available from the Family Campsite and Kids Area. Remember to check this each day to ensure it's still legible.</li>
			<li>Always hold hands or carry your children through busy areas.</li>
			<li>Educate your children on what to do if they get separated from you. Advise them to stay where they are and not to move or go with anyone until a Garda or Steward approaches them. They should indicate their phone number to the Garda or Steward.</li>
			<li>Children must be accompanied by Parent/Guardian at ALL times.</li>
